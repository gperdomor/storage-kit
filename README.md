# StorageKit

A protocol based storage framework to provide an easy way integrate and use third-party storage providers in Vapor.

Main goals:
- Provide a common way to manipulate files in your app without worry about the provider (local, S3, Azure, GCS).
- Allow users to switch between storage providers without (or minimal) changes to the source code of their apps.
